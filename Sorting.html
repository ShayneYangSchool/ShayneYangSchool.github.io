                        Binary search is quick and all, but it suffers from the problem of that the array needs to be sorted beforehand. So, how do programmers sort an array? Well, there are many, many different algorithms that can sort an array. This can range anywhere from basic sorting algorithms such as selection sort to more advanced ones like merge sort. Below are explanation of the sorting algorithms mentioned above.

                        What is Sorting Stability

                        Before we talk about the sorting algorithms, let's talk about a property of it. Stability is the property of whether elements of the same value appear in the same relative order in both the unsorted array and the sorted array. An algorithm is said to be stable if this does happen and unstable if it doesn't. This could be important to a programmer as these values may be tied to other values that need to remain in order.

                        Selection sort is one of the most basic types of sorting. It constantly selects the smallest element of the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion of the array, until it reaches the end. But how do we know what portion of the array is unsorted? Well, it is easier to take a look at an example. If there is an array of length 10, when the algorithm first starts out, it doesn't know if any of the elements are sorted. Thus, it declares the entire array to be the unsorted array. It will then pick the smallest element within the portion (the entire array) to swap it with the first element. After the first swap, the algorithm now knows that the first element is in the correct position. Thus, the first element is now sorted and the unsorted portion becomes the portion between the second element and the last element. It will then repeat this until it determines that every element is in the correct position. Selection sort has an average time complexity of O(n^2) and is not a stable sort. This is because when swapping elements, it may send an element that was previously in front of another element of the value to behind it.

                        Merge Sort

                        Another sorting algorithm is merge sort. This algorithm is more advanced than selection sort and performs much better on larger data sets. It is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm, meaning it breaks the array down into more manageable tasks. Given an array, it will perform the following steps until the array is declared to be sorted:
                        <br><br>
                         - If the array has a length of 1, it must be sorted and end the method
                        <br>
                         - If it isn't, find the middle and create two separate arrays by splitting down the middle (One array will include the middle element)
                        <br>
                         - Perform merge sort on the two arrays
                        <br>
                         - Once sorted, merge these two sorted arrays to create one big sorted array
                        <br><br>
                        Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) as well as being a stable sort. The following implementation is recursive (Recursion is explained later in the recursion lesson)
